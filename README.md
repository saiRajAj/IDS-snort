## Project Overview
This project demonstrates the implementation of a **Network-based Intrusion Detection System (NIDS)** using **Snort 3 (Snort++)** on a Linux platform. The IDS continuously monitors live network traffic and generates alerts when suspicious activity is detected based on custom-defined rules.

As a proof of concept, the system is configured to detect **ICMP (ping) traffic**, which is commonly used during network reconnaissance and initial attack phases.

This project is fully automated using a single Bash script and is suitable for **internship submission, college projects, GitHub portfolios, and interviews**.

## Objectives
- To understand the working principles of an Intrusion Detection System
- To install and configure Snort 3 on Linux
- To write and deploy custom Snort detection rules
- To monitor live network traffic
- To detect ICMP-based reconnaissance activity
- To automate IDS deployment using Bash scripting

---

## About Snort
Snort is a widely used open-source Intrusion Detection and Prevention System (IDS/IPS).  
It is extensively used in **Security Operations Centers (SOC)** and enterprise environments.

### Snort 3 (Snort++) Features
- Lua-based configuration
- Modular and scalable architecture
- Improved performance over Snort 2
- Enhanced rule processing and detection engine

---

## Tools & Technologies Used
- Snort 3 (Snort++)
- Linux (Kali Linux / Ubuntu)
- Bash Scripting
- TCP/IP Networking
- ICMP Protocol
- Virtual Machine (VMware / VirtualBox)
